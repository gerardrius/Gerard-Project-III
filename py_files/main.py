# PONDERATION
# Normalization function
    # density_or_points_normalizer (df, query)
    # explanation:  normalizes all values of distance or density between 0 and 1. In density, the higher it is, the closer to 1; in distance, the shortest, the closest to 1.
    #               The highest value will get a 1, the lowest a 0. Intermediate values are distributed within the proportion between original min and max.
